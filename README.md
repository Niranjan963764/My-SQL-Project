# My-SQL-Project
I have worked on various database concepts and gained hands-on experience during my project. I created views, common table expressions (CTEs), stored procedures, functions, and event triggers.
 Additionally, I designed and created multiple tables to analyze organizational sales and financial data, ensuring the data was cleaned and presented in a human-readable format
